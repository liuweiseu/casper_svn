Programming uboot
-----------------

boards should be already programmed, but uboot
can program a new version of itself. Use the 

=> run newuboot 

macro and ymodem. You shouldn't need to do it
normally though ...

Programming a kernel 
--------------------

Uboot should understand the macro newkernel, Use it
to program a new uImage to flash. Type

=> run newkernel

then upload the kernel image using ymodem. The
kernel gets written to the start of flash. Use
bootm to load it.

Filesystems
-----------

You can install a filesystem into flash (the
partitions are set on the commandline) or mount
it via nfs.

tcpborphserver
--------------

Cross compile it for the power PC, make it 
part of the filesystem. If you run it, you can
telnet to port 7147 to control borph processes.

tcpborphserver2
---------------

New shiny replacement for tcpborphserver. Same
syntax, but now has modes. A raw mode provides
conventional read and write commands, the poco
mode provides a personality for a particular
image (poco.bof) to contorl Andrew's pocket 
correlator

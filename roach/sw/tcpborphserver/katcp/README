API 

  described in the file API

Example code:

  examples/client-example.c  - high level api example which connects to server
  examples/server-example    - high level api example which runs a server
  examples/multi-server.c    - server servicing multiple client connections, using own service loop
  examples/echo.c            - server example providing an echo command

Test code:

  in tests/                  - should be improved

Useful executable:

  utils/katcpcmd             - commandline utility with some options. 
                               But telnet or socat will do as well.

Other implementations:

  There are pure Python and Java implementations of the katcp protocol
  available in at https://katfs.kat.ac.za/svnCONRAD/Common/katcp-python and
  https://katfs.kat.ac.za/svnCONRAD/Common/katcp-java.

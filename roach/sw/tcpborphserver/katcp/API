To use the api include <katcp.h> and link against -lkatcp. You
may need to set the include search path with -I and library
search path with -L

The makefile only generates a static library (.a), but shared
libraries could also be built (but do remember the -fPIC
compiler flag)

The katcp API has several "layers"

 - A top level where the service main loop is implemented 
   inside an API function. Examples using this are the 
   examples/client-example.c and examples/server-example.c code. 
   
   A user of this API initialises the system using 
   startup_katcp, registers commands using the 
   register_katcp call. Once this has set up, the
   main loop is started with either run_client_katcp
   or run_server_katcp. Final clean ups are done
   using shutdown_katcp.

   This approach handles the network logic for the user,
   but doesn't make provisions for handling periodic events.

   Inside a command function (the one passed to
   register_katcp), users can call arg_*_katcp
   to access parameters and append_*_katcp, send_katcp
   and log_message_katcp to generate output. 

   Internally the katcp library implements these 
   functions in loop.c and netc.c.

 - A intermediate level, where the user implements his
   or her own main loop (probably using some select
   variant), but still uses a katcp_dispatch structure
   to register functions, dispatch them, etc. The
   internals of a command function remain similar to
   the higher level case (arg_*_katcp, append_*_katcp, etc).

   This logic is implemented inside dispatch.c, but loop.c
   may be helpful as a starting point for a users own 
   main loop. A slightly different example can also be
   found in examples/multi-server.c

 - A lower level where only the protocol parsing logic of
   the library is used. Here the programmer implements
   his or her own main loop and dispatch logic. The functions
   used to parse the protocol are defined in line.c and
   are distinguished by a *_katcl (*not* a *_katcp) suffix. Thus
   it is sufficient to include only katcl.h

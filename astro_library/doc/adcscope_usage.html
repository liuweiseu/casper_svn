<h1>ADC scope usage</h1>
<h2>Christina de Jesus, August 2006</h2>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The fully parameterized, masked ADC scope block allows the user to capture ADC board samples.
  Samples are stored into two BRAMs per ADC of programmable length.  
  Their respective overflow bits are stored in two more BRAMs per ADC.  This makes a total of 4 BRAMs per ADC.  
  Samples may be viewed via <pre>pocketplot -g -a</pre>.  
  A combined histogram of the sample levels may be viewed with the -ah option.  Overflow flags 
  are displayed as red dots on top of the samples that overflowed; flags at zero indicate no overflow.
  pocketplot will format and display the samples as 8.7 signed numbers. 
  (8.7 indicates an 8-bit number with the binary point at the seventh bit, e.g. 0.1010101)</p>
  
<h2>Data storage in BRAM</h2>
<p>Each row in a BRAM is 32 bits wide.  Each ADC sample is 8 bits wide; hence there are 4 samples per row.
The following shows the order in which samples are stored, from MSB to LSB.</p>
<p>Samples (interleaved):<br>
	BRAMI Row 1:  o0 o1 o2 o3<br>
	BRAMI Row 2:  o8 o9 o10 o11<br>
	BRAMQ Row 1:  o4 o5 o6 o7<br>
	BRAMQ Row 2:  o12 o13 o14 o15<br>
	etc.<br>
	Samples (noninterleaved):<br>
	BRAMI Row 1:  i0 i1 i2 i3<br>
	BRAMQ Row 1:  q0 q1 q2 q3<br>
	BRAMI Row 2:  i4 i5 i6 i7<br>
	BRAMQ Row 2:  q4 q5 q6 q7<br>
etc.</p>

<p>Each overflow bit corresponds to two ADC samples.  OF bits are stored as unsigned bytes in BRAM; hence there are 4 overflow bytes per row.
The following shows the order in which overflow bits are stored, from MSB to LSB.</p>
<p>Overflow bits (interleaved):<br>
	oorBRAM0 Row 1:  o1 o3 o0 o2<br>
	oorBRAM0 Row 2:  o5 o7 o4 o6<br>etc.<br>
	Overflow bits (noninterleaved):<br>
	oorBRAM0 Row 1:  i0 i1 q0 q1<br>
	oorBRAM0 Row 2:  i2 i3 q2 q3<br>
	etc.
</p>
<p>The following shows the correspondence between samples and overflow bits.
	</p>
	
<p>	Interleaved:<br>
	------------------------------------------------<br>
	Sample | o0 | o1 | o2 | o3 | o4 | o5 | o6 | o7 |<br>
	------------------------------------------------<br>
	OF bit | o0 | o1 | o0 | o1 | o2 | o3 | o2 | o3 |<br>
	------------------------------------------------<br>
	<br>
	Noninterleaved:<br>
	------------------------------------------------<br>
	Sample | i0 | i1 | i2 | i3 | q0 | q1 | q2 | q3 |<br>
	------------------------------------------------<br>
	OF bit | i0 | i0 | i1 | i1 | q0 | q0 | q1 | q1 |<br>
	------------------------------------------------<br>
</p>

<p>The PowerPC code reads out the BRAMs in the appropriate order for pocketplot.</p>

<h2>Resource utilization</h2>
<p>On the IBOB's Xilinx 2vp50s, the two-ADC scope compiled at 256 MHz (ADCs running at 1024MHz) 
uses 10% (2433/23616) of available slices and 24% (56/232) of available BRAM.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Number of ADCs:  indicates how many ADCs to connect to the scope.</li>
<li>Interleave mode:  checking the box indicates that the ADCs are interleaved, 
leaving it clear indicates that they are not.  If there are two ADCs in the design, 
this setting applies to both of them (for this block, it is not possible for one ADC to be 
interleaved and the other to not be interleaved).</li>
<li>BRAM address width (2^?): indicates the number of rows in each of the BRAMs.  
	Must be at least 11 (2048 rows; this is a BRAM block constraint).  
	This setting applies to all BRAM in the block.  Each row contains four samples.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>Sometimes the block may not redraw itself properly (e.g. ports aren't in the correct order); if this occurs, delete the existing block 
from your design and drop in another one from the library.  Updating the design (Ctrl-D) may also 
help.</p>
<p>When compiling designs with only 1 ADC attached to the scope, the <pre>if (NUM_ADCS == 2)</pre>
sections of the PowerPC code must be commented out to avoid compilation errors.  This affects 
scopedump and scopeasciidump.</p>

<h1>CIC filter usage</h1>
<h2>Christina de Jesus, July 2006</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Described by Eugene Hogenauer in his classic 1981 paper, the cascaded 
integrator-comb filter, or CIC, is very useful as an 
anti-aliasing filter as well as a high-rate decimating or interpolating
 filter.  Composed of only adders and subtractors, it is an attractive 
 candidate for implementation in FPGAs where multipliers are in short supply.
CICs are linear-phase FIR filters with a sinc-like frequency response; compensation 
via a FIR filter with an inverse sinc frequency response is often necessary to raise
 their drooping passband to acceptable levels.</p>
 
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>As its name suggests, the CIC is composed of integrators and comb filters in series, 
 sometimes with a decimation or interpolation block between the integrators and combs 
 or after the entire filter.  In his implementation, Hogenauer inserts a 
 decimation/interpolation block between the integrators and comb filters; this arrangement 
 allows one of the sections to operate at a lower clock frequency, therefore reducing 
 power consumption.  It is not necessary to decimate or interpolate with the filter, though 
 it is very common to do so.</p>
 <p>In a CIC decimator, the integrator section precedes the comb filter section; an interpolator 
 is the reverse.  An integrator is simply an adder whose output is delayed by 1 cycle and fed back 
 to itself.
</p>


<pre>
         __________
in ---->|          |
        |    +     |>---+-> out
  +---->|__________|    |
  |        ___          |
  |       |   |         |

          |___|
</pre>


<p>A comb filter is much like an integrator, except that its input is delayed by a certain amount 
called the differential delay D and then subtracted from its input.
</p>


<pre>
                   __________               
in --+----------->|          |
     |    ___     |     _    |>-----> out
     |   |   |    |          |    
     +-->|-D |>-->|__________|
         |___|
</pre>


<p>A single-stage CIC decimator is formed by cascading one integrator with one comb filter.  A
N-stage CIC decimator is formed by cascading N integrators with N comb filters.</p>

<p>This CIC block was modeled closely on that provided in the Xilinx LogiCORE library.  Key differences 
include multiple inputs, arbitrary differential delay, and optional decimation.  This block does not 
implement interpolation.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>CIC filters are completely defined by three parameters: 
<ul>
<li>differential delay D</li>
<li>decimation/interpolation factor R</li>
<li>number of stages N.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Additional implementation parameters for this CIC block:
<ul>
<li>Number of inputs: This must be greater than or equal to 1.  Inputs are real-valued.</li>
<li>Input bitwidth</li>
<li>Input binary point: relative to LSB.</li>
<li>Pipeline: this will add a delay of 1 after each integrator and comb.
<li>Adder latency: Sets the latency of the adders in the adder tree (multiple inputs only).</li>
<li>Integrator latency:  Sets the latency of the integrator adders.  
This must be 1, otherwise the adders are no longer integrators!</li>
<li>Comb latency:  Sets the latency of the comb subtractors.  Values beyond 1 merely pipeline the subtractors.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Frequency response</h2>
<p>The transfer function of a CIC filter is</p>
<p>
<pre>
H(z) = (1 - z^-DR)^N
       ------------- , (Hogenauer81)
       (1 - z^-1)^N
</pre>
</p>
<p>or simply the product of the integrator and comb filter's transfer functions.</p>

<p>Its magnitude response as a function of f relative to fs, the sampling rate, is </p>
<p>
<pre>
| (sin (pi * D * f)) |^N
| ----------------   |    (Hogenauer 81)
| (sin (pi * f / R)) | 

</pre>
</p>
<p>and its DC gain is <pre>(RD)^N. (Donadio)</pre></p>

<p>The bit growth at the output is <pre>Bout = N log2(RD) + Bin. (Donadio)</pre>  Overflow in the integrator stage 
is fully compensated by the comb stage as long as two's complement arithmetic is used and the number system can fully represent 
the largest value expected at the output of all the filters.</p>

<p>Increasing N will increase output bitgrowth as well as passband attenuation and droop, 
possibly requiring the use of a compensatory FIR filter with an inverse sinc response 
after the CIC filter.  Increasing D will increase the number of nulls in the frequency 
response (one occurs every f = fs/D, where fs is the sampling rate).  Increasing R 
will increase DC gain.  Increasing both D and R will also increase bitgrowth at the output.</p>

<p>A designer-determined passband cutoff frequency fc will also determine where aliasing bands occur.  
They are centered around the nulls in the frequency response, and extend over the interval</p>
<p>(i - fc) <= f <= (i + fc) for f <= fs/2 and i = 1, 2, ..., floor(R/2). (Donadio)</p>

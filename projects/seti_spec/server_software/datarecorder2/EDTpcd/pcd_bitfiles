#
# EDT PCD boards are equipped with a "PCI Xilinx" which has the DMA
# engine used to transfer data to/from the host computer.  The PCI
# Xilinx is loaded at power-up from a flash PROM on the EDT board so it
# is available as the system configures during boot.  The flash PROM
# may be loaded by the program "pciload" which is described in the
# "PCI CD User's Guide".  Changes to the flash take effect after the
# power to the computer is turned off and back on.
#
# A second Xilinx FPGA called the "Interface Xilinx" talks directly to the 
# user's equipment, and may be loaded at anytime by the program "bitload".
# The "pcdrequest" program accepts menu selections to create a script to
# load the interface bitfiles.
# 
# The PCI flash loaded determines which interface Xilinx bitfiles can be
# utilized on the PCI CD board.  The dependencies listed here are used
# by the "pcdrequest" program.

			PCI SS 16-bit Parallel I/O

OVERVIEW

    The PCI SS board with the RS422 or LVDS option supports high speed
    parallel I/O similar to the PCI CD running pcd_src.bit or pcd_looped.bit.


CONFIGURATION

    The PCI SS must have the pciss1.bit loaded in the PCI flash prom.
    To check this run "pciload" and you should see "pciss1" in the
    output text:

	% cd /opt/EDTpcd (or \edt\pcd on Windows)
	% pciload

	pcd unit 3 (pci ss-4):
	  XC2S150 Xilinx, AMD 29LV040B FPROM
	  Sector 0
	  Sector 1
	  Sector 2  PROM id: <pciss1_p.ncd 2s150fg456 2002/01/16 13:44:44>
	  Sector 3  PROM id: <pciss1_p_5v.ncd 2s150fg456 2002/01/16 13:45:02>

    To load pciss1, run "pciload -u <unit#> pciss1" and answer the prompts.
    Cycle the power on the computer to load the new PCI firmware.


    The Interface Xilinx is loaded using "bitload -u <unit#> ss_pci.bit".

    To drive TXT from the onboard oscillator or PLL, clear the 0x02 bit
    in the PCD_CONFIG register (same as pcd_src.bit on PCI CD).

    To drive TXT looped from RXT, set the 0x02 bit in the PCD_CONFIG
    register (same as pcd_looped.bit on PCI CD).


TESTING AND SAMPLE PROGRAMS

    Most sample parallel DMA programs shipped with the PCD driver, such as
    simple_getdata.c and simple_putdata.c, will work with this configuration.  

    For this test use pcdin.c and pcdout.c.  Configure two boards as above,
    and set one for internal TXT and one for looped TXT.  Connect the boards
    with a CAB-BB cable and run the following commands in separate windows:

	% pcdin -u <first_unit#>
	% pcdout -u <second_unit#>

    Wait until each program prints "Hit return to continue", then press
    return first in the pcdin window and second in the pcdout window.
    pcdin will print a '.' for each buffer transferred and verified, while 
    pcdout will print a 'o' for each buffer output.  1000 buffers will
    be transferred in ring buffer mode from one board to the other..

    You may also use modified versions of pcdin.c or pcdout.c to communicate
    with your device.

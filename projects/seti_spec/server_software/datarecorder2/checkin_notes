    - dr2, version 2.0 installed at Arecibo.

    - Introduced variable WasIdle to save idle state across diskbuf loop
      iterations.  Idle is potentially getting reset and thus MissingBufs
      not getting passed the FormatHeader().
    - Save off the log (dr2_log) for archiving after each exit from dr2.
    - Copy the saved off log to siren for transfer to SSL.

    ./
        diskbuf.C
        do_dr2.csh
        copy_quicklook.csh do_dr2.csh

    - Added script read_dr2_tape.csh.

    ./
        read_dr2_tape.csh

9/4/02 jeffc Added the second card to the system.  The edt_load program found
both cards and set up /dev/ entries for them.

Some disk errors on setirec2.  Had to do a long fsck on bootup
and measages still says:

I was able to read the 2nd card fine with simple_getdata.  I had to actually 
connect the data cable to the card in order to read it, even though there
were no data on the cable.  Was this because of a clock loopback?  The cable
had to be attached to the test jig for this to work.

The EDT card init script (/etc/init.d/edt) is now working and all cards
are ready to go on host bootup.  I needed a link in rc5.d as 5 is the 
default multiuser run level for linux.

11/1/02 jeffc
Was getting "system call interupted" on one the 2 calls to edt_wait_for_buffers until
I checked some old email from EDT which stated:
	libedt is not thread-safe.  You need to call edt_wait_for_buffers()
	from the same thread that called edt_open() and edt_configure_ring_buffers().
So I moved the call to InitEdt() from main() to MemBufFunc() and all was well.

9/14/02 jeffc
I reinstalled linux because of the ufs error requiring fsck on every boot
(see entry 9/25/02).  I went up to RH 7.3.  The first disk was partitioned as:
	sda1    /boot   	39
        sda5    /       	4096/5
        sda6    swap    	2048/7
        sda7    /mydisks/a      11178
I installed all packages excpet:
	laptop support
         news serv
         winfile server
         ftp server
         sql server
         dns server
         network managed workstation
         games
The install size was 2229MB.
I installed the EDT drivers (EDT PCI 3.2).  I had to create a link
in/usr/src: linux->linux.4.  Upon running edt_load, both cards were
found and appropriate /dev entries were made.

9/21/02 jeffc
finishing up the config of setirec2:
	/etc/hosts
	/etc/fstab
	/etc/passwd
	/etc/shadow
	/etc/sysconfig/ipchains : for NFS mounts to work, I had to comment out:
		#-A input -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p udp -j REJECT

12/22/02 jeffc
Set up EDT startup scripts:
	/etc/rc.d/init.d

	/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S99edt -> ../init.d/edt

So, the software that came on the CD lacks the all important program pcdrequest,
which produces a script for loading the correct bit files up to the card(s).
I downloaded the latest SW from EDT and installed it.  See installpcd.out.11_21_2002.
The install script installpcd put new, more involved start scripts into 
/etc/rc.d/init.d with a link out in /etc/rc.d/rc5.d.  I removed the ones I put there.
The new is called edtinit.  I had to run it before running pcdrequest.  OK, I 
then finally ran pcd request and was presented with:
	    Available interface bitfiles:

    0. Do Not Configure  -  Applications will load the interface bitfile
    1. pcd_src.bit       -  16-bit parallel I/O synced to PCD source clock
    2. pcd_looped.bit    -  16-bit parallel I/O synced to external clock
    3. pcd8_src.bit      -  8-bit parallel dual channel I/O synced to PCD clock
    4. ssd.bit           -  One channel serial input
    5. ssd2.bit          -  Two channel serial input
    6. ssd4.bit          -  Four channel serial input
    7. ssdio.bit         -  Dual channel serial I/O
    8. ssdio_neg.bit     -  Dual channel serial I/O using negative clock edge
    9. ssdout1.bit       -  One channel serial output

I chose bitfile 1 for each card.  This produced the script pcdload.  I ran it and 
it said:

	file <./bitfiles/4013/pcd_src.bit>
	id: "pcd_src.ncd 4013xlapq208 2002/02/20 13:50:11" loaded
	file <./bitfiles/4013/pcd_src.bit>
	id: "pcd_src.ncd 4013xlapq208 2002/02/20 13:50:11" loaded

We ran into a linux problem on setirec2 yesterday.  We could not access (eg via a "cp" 
command) NFS files (from a solaris server) that were beyond a certain size (1*rsize or 
1*wsize?)  The cp would hang and the entire system would slow way down.  The cp could 
not be killed.  Setirec2 emitted:

        setirec2 kernel: nfs: task <pid> can't get a request slot

We tried setting rsize/wsize to 32K as per the NFS HOWTO.  This did not help.
The cp seemed to hang at 1*{r,w}size.  Finally, I forced NFS version 2 on the mount 
lines on fstab and the problem cleared up.

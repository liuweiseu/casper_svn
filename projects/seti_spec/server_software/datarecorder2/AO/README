Other than ./lib, the directories in this directory
contain production code that has been copied here from
the AO NFS.  The directory names are such that replacing
"_" with "/" will yield the pathname on the AO NFS. 

Diffs can be checked by copying the directories from the
AO NFS to ~/AO and running:

    check_ao_code_sync  

./lib needs to contain:

    flip.o  jtest.o  scram.o  swapdata.o libazzatoradec.a 

To build the .o files, run make in:

    _home_cima_Wapp_Bin_Sources_Lib_linux

Note that you may have to:
     yum install tk-devel.i386
     yum install tk.i386
to get tk.h and related files.

To build libazzatoradec.a, run make in:

    _home_phil_vw_pnt_exportCode

The location of the header files included in ../dr2.h are 
as follows:

    _home_phil_vw_h/mshmLib.h
    _home_phil_vw_h/vtxLib.h
    _home_cima_Wapp_Bin_Sources_Includes/execshm.h
    _home_cima_Wapp_Bin_Sources_Includes/wappshm.h
    _home_cima_Wapp_Bin_Sources_Includes/wapplib.h
    _home_cima_Wapp_Bin_Sources_Includes/alfashm.h
    _home_cima_Wapp_Bin_Sources_Includes/scram.h

These are the sole locations for these header files.  If this
fact is ever found to have changed, the situation should be
studied with the help of AO engineers, in particular Phil Perillat
and Mikael Lerner.

Note that _home_phil_vw_pnt_exportCode is a collection of
files that Phil Perillat put together just for us.  If there
is a discrepancy between any file in that directory and another
version of the file located elsewhere, the file elsewhere should
be considered canonical.  As an example, the .dat files can
undergo changes in the AO production directories but not get
updated in "exportCode".  In fact, this is common enough that
the .dat files in exportCode have been made into symlinks to
their cononical locations elsewhere.  Other such symlinks may
appear as well.

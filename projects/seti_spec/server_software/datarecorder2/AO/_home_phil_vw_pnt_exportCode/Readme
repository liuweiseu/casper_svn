convert az za to ra dec J2000 for arecibo.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The important things in this directory are:

0. this Readme
1. azzaToRaDec.c() the subroutine that does the work converting az,za to
                   Ra dec
2. azzaToRaDec.h   the include file that you'll have to edit (see below)
3. testazzatoradec.c A test program to see if things work and how to
                   use them.
4. Makefile        to compile the subroutines into a library
                   and the test program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to edit so it will compile/work

1. place the files in a directory of your own.
3. edit azzaToRaDec.h
   -
   #define FILES_DIR         "/home/phil/vw/pnt/exportCode"
	change FILES_DIR to the location where you are going to keep the
    two .dat files. These are needed at run time.

4. edit the Makefile

SRCDIR = /home/phil/vw/pnt/exportCode
  .. set to wherever you put the source code

LIBDIR = $(SRCDIR)
  .. where you want the library to end up..

LIBNM=azzatoradec
  .. whatever you want to call the library. without lib or .a (for -l) 

then:

make 

You should end up with
1. the executable test program testazzatoradec
2. the library...default name libazzatoradec.a
3. I left the time input at mjd and utcFraction. You could change
   it to whatever is more convenient...seconds from 1970,
   ast day,mon,year, hour,min,sec...etc
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


To test if it is working, log into ao and run
   /home/phil/vw/Solaris/bin/pntMonGet 
   It will output to standard out once a second the current
pointing state:

Grab the Rslt line:   
        Ra          Dec
Rslt:  11:50:25.7  19:50:02.0 Cs:J

This is the radec j2000 for the reqP az,za values:
         azdeg         zaDeg
reqP:    254.0849       5.8497

Also grab the time info that goes with it..


The difference will be the model correction (which is printed
in the line:
           azDeg       zaDeg
cor :     -0.6551      -0.0041

These values are added to the computed az,za to get the encoder az,za.


If you don't wanna log in, just see if you can duplicate the above
values..

GOTCHA'S:

The utcToUt1 uses the data file utcToUt1.dat

this file gets updated every time a leap second is inserted. It is
also updated when the linear approximation to the utc to ut1 fit
gets large (usually around 100 ms..).  Look in the file for 
how often it is updated...

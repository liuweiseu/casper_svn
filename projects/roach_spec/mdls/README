To run the model file:
You will need Suraj's tree of the casper repository, which you can clone 
via git:

git clone git://casper.berkeley.edu/~sgowda/mlib_devel.git

Also, since this model file uses an older copy of Suraj's library, try to
avoid library versions which modify the butterfly_direct block

To compile the model file:
PlanAhead was used to get this model to meet timing.  Constraints file/PlanAhead
project coming soon.

Pocket Spectrometer WalletChain Installation Instructions 
February, 2006


OPERATING SYSTEM: 
The WalletChain software was developed on a GNU/Linux
platform, but should compile under most *nixs.


DEPENDENCIES: 
The WalletChain software uses a plotting tool called 'GNUPlot' to
plot spectra. This tool is commonly installed with many *nix distributions.  It
is necessary for GNUPlot version 4.0 or higher to be installed and accessible in
your path for the WalletChain programs to function properly. To check if your
system has GNUPlot installed, simply enter 'gnuplot' on the command line.  If
nothing happens, then GNUPlot needs to be installed.  GNUPlot is available from
www.gnuplot.org for many different operating systems.  If you already have
GNUPlot installed, version information can be found by typing 'show version' on
the GNUPlot command line.  If you have a version older than 4.0, you will need
to install an updated version.


INSTALLATION: 
The WalletChain software distribution is contained in the file
'walletchain.tar.gz', which will decompress into the directory 'walletchain' 
Before attempting compilation, you must edit the WalletChain source code to
reflect the particular system on which it is installed.


#1.

Line 20 of 'walletchain/pocketplot.c' reads:

	#include "/root/walletchain/gnuplot_i/gnuplot_i.h"

This line should be edited so that it accurately contains the path to the
installation directory. For example, if you decompressed 'walletchain.tar.gz' to
the directory '/home/jdoe', Line 20 should read:

	#include "/home/jdoe/walletchain/gnuplot_i/gnuplot_i.h"

Be sure and use an absolute path here, rather than a relative one such as
'../jdoe/' or '~jdoe/'

#2.

Line 39 of 'walletchain/pocketplot.c' reads:

	char specport[100]="/dev/ttyS0";

And line 19 of 'walletchain/setacc.c' also reads:

	char specport[100]="/dev/ttyS0";

These lines specify the device name for the serial port used to access the iBob.
 They may need to be changed if your iBob is connected to a serial device other
than 'ttyS0'  For information on the serial ports installed on your system try
'man setserial'


Once the above has been completed, simply run the shell script 'compile' in the
'walletchain' directory using the command './compile'  If all goes well two
binaries should be created, 'pocketplot' and 'setacc'

USAGE: 
The program pocketplot connects to the iBob over the serial port, then
continually receives and plots frequency spectra using GNUPlot.  GNUPlot has
many useful features, such as mouse zooming and log-plotting.  For instructions
on using these, refer to the documentation included in your GNUPlot
distribution.
Inputs: (none)
Example: ./pocketplot

The program setacc connects to the iBob over the serial port and sets the number
of input spectra to be accumulated.  This program is not meant to be used while
pocketplot is running.
Inputs: <accumulation length>
Example: ./setacc 0xffff

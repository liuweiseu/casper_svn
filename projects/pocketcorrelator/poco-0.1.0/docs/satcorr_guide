The most recent PoCo software is in the CASPER SVN repo at http://casper.berkeley.edu/svn/trunk/PocketCorrelator/

See the poco_ser_guide file for more information on the use of PoCo

*The bitfile for the poco is loaded into the PROM of the iBOB so just turning on PoCo will start the system running

*satcorr_108.bit is the current bit file in PoCo

*useful files are in the /home/obs/poco-0.1.0/ directory

*in the poco dir are a number of c files/programs and a python scripts  with correlator to miriad scripts

starting poco:

1. once poco is turned on and supplied with 108 MHz to each ADC clock the correlator needs to be configured. there is a program called poco_conf which will do this.

./poco_conf config52000.txt 169.254.128.1

the cofig file loads the equalizations, integration times, the ip to transmit data to and the fft shift schedule. (the program ./configure creates this config file if you want to update it). the ip address is the hard set ip address of the iBOB.

2. after the iBOB is configured there are two routes to take, the first is just to collect the raw data, this is useful for diagnostics or if you want to write to another format then MIRAID UV. The other option is to run the python scripts to create MIRIAD UV files which can be viewed in MIRIAD and aipy.

Raw Data:

a. ./udprec

This program collects the UDP packets and dumps then to a .log file, ./udprec -h will give options on the number of files to write, naming, and number of packets per file

b. ./corrplot poco_data0.log

This program will load the grace plotting program and realtime plot the raw poco data being received. There is also a program ./corrplot_log which will plot the amplitudes on a log plot

MIRIAD Data:

In the python/ dir is a script called poco_rx.py which is based on cn_rx.py from the correlator software, this script uses a modified version of the corr-0.3.0 package which is currently installed on paper0.

a. ./poco_rx.py poco2.conf

This script uses a similar config file as the correlator setup, a few edits have been made to this config file to make it more useful for PoCo, a -s option will grab a single time file of data. files will be written out as poco.[julian date].uv. Note: with sub seond integration times MIRIAD does not correctly report the time.

Notes on PoCo:

The design is currently running at 108 MHz, which gives the system a 27 MHz band, for our can we are looking at the 121.5 - 148.5 MHz band.

Anytime a new cofiguration is needed(i.e. ./poco_conf is run) the system should be power cycled first

To directly access the iBOB telnet into it:
telnet 169.254.128.1

listdev
regread adc_sum_sq

are useful commands in the iBOB
